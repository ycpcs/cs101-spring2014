**Windows**

> [Installing Cygwin](installCygwin.html) - detailed instructions on how to install the Cygwin software needed to compile, run, and submit programs.
>
> [Installing Notepad++](installNotepadpp.html) - detailed instructions on how to install the Notepad++ text editor (which we are using in class to edit C/C++ programs).
>
> Installing Visual Studio 2012 Pro - Go to [MSDNAA](http://msdn05.e-academy.com/elms/Storefront/Home.aspx?campus=ycp_physci) and log in to your MSDNAA account using your YCP *email address* (use the "I've forgotten my password!" if you do not remember your password). Select the **Visual Studio 2012 Professional** icon and proceed through the checkout process (there is no charge for the software). Download the DVD .iso file, burn it to a blank DVD using .iso burning software, and then install from the DVD. NOTE: for Mac users, you will either need to install Visual Studio on a Windows bootcamp partition or in a Windows virtual machine.

**Mac**

> Install Xcode by downloading it from the Mac App Store (free). After XCode is installed, go to XCode &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Downloads and install **Command Line Tools**. Then use a **Terminal** (located in Applications/Utilities) wherever cygwin would be used in Windows. You may use any text editor for editing the source files, e.g. TextEdit, or a nice (free) one is [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/).

**Linux**

> Make sure that you have g++, make, curl, and the ncurses development libraries installed. For example, under Ubuntu or Debian Linux, run the command
>
>     sudo apt-get install g++ make curl libncurses5-dev
>
> from a terminal window.
>
> You can use any text editor to edit your code: for example, gedit and kate are both good choices (and are similar to Notepad++). Under Ubuntu or Debian:
>
>     sudo apt-get install gedit
>     sudo apt-get install kate
