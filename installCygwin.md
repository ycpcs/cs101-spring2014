title: Installing Cygwin
---

This page describes how to install the [cygwin](http://cygwin.com/) tools you will need to compile, run, and submit programs in CS 101. These notes assume that you are installing on a Windows system.

**Step 1**: Go to <http://cygwin.com/>. Click the **Install Cygwin** tab in the left hand column and click the **setup.exe** to download the setup program. Run the setup program which you just downloaded.

You should see the following window:

> ![image](images/setup1.png)

Click **Next**.

**Step 2**: You will see the "Choose Installation Type" window:

> ![image](images/setup2.png)

Choose "Install from Internet" and click **Next**.

**Step 3**: You will see the "Choose Installation Directory" window:

> ![image](images/setup3.png)

Keep the defaults (install to **C:\\cygwin**, install for All Users.) Click **Next**.

**Step 4**: Next is the "Select Local Package Directory" window:

> ![image](images/setup4.png)

Rather than accepting the default, create a directory within your Desktop directory, click **Browse**, and choose that directory as your local package directory. For example, I used:

> ![image](images/setup5.png)

Click **Next**.

**Step 5**: Next is the "Select Connection Type" window:

> ![image](images/setup6.png)

Choose "Direct Connection". Click **Next**.

**Step 6**: You should now see the "Choose Download Site(s)" window:

> ![image](images/setup7.png)

You can choose any download site. An HTTP site might work better than an FTP site. Click **Next**.

**Step 7**: You will now see the "Select Packages" window:

> ![image](images/setup8.png)

You will need to install the following packages:

> <table>
> <col width="20%" />
> <col width="48%" />
> <thead>
> <tr class="header">
> <th align="left">Category</th>
> <th align="left">Packages</th>
> </tr>
> </thead>
> <tbody>
> <tr class="odd">
> <td align="left">Archive</td>
> <td align="left">zip, unzip</td>
> </tr>
> <tr class="even">
> <td align="left">Devel</td>
> <td align="left">gcc-g++, libncurses-devel, make</td>
> </tr>
> <tr class="odd">
> <td align="left">Interpreters</td>
> <td align="left">perl</td>
> </tr>
> <tr class="even">
> <td align="left">Lib</td>
> <td align="left">libsasl2</td>
> </tr>
> <tr class="odd">
> <td align="left">Net</td>
> <td align="left">curl, openssh</td>
> </tr>
> </tbody>
> </table>
>
To choose a package, expand its category, then click on the word "Skip" to the left of the package name. The word "Skip" will be replaced by a version number. For example, after choosing the "curl" package in the "Net" category, my window looked like this:

> ![image](images/setup9.png)

You may install additional packages if you would like to.

When you have selected the required packages, click **Next**. You will see a progress dialog. It may take a while for all of the packages to be downloaded and installed.

**Step 8**: You're done! You should see a window that looks like the following:

> ![image](images/setup10.png)

Make sure that you add at least one icon (to the Desktop or Start Menu).

You can now start the Cygwin bash shell by clicking on the **Cygwin** icon on the Desktop or the **Start-\>All Programs-\>Cygwin-\>Cywgin Bash Shell** menu item.
