This schedule is subject to change.  Any change will be
announced in class and on the course web page.

**Important**: We expect that when you come to class you will have (a) done the reading, and (b) done any CloudCoder exercises that have been assigned for the reading.  Most class meetings will have a quiz that will test your understanding of the material in the reading.

**CloudCoder Exercises**: To work on an exercise, just click on the name of
the exercise.  You may be prompted to enter your CloudCoder username
and password.
