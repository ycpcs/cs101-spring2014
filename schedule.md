**Important**: For each class meeting listed in the schedule, please do the reading and CloudCoder exercises **before** you come to class.  Most class meetings will have a quiz that will test your understanding of the current topic(s).

**CloudCoder Exercises**: To work on an exercise, just click on the name of the exercise.  You may be prompted to enter your CloudCoder username and password.  Note that exercises marked with a gold star (<img src="{{site.url}}/images/goldstar-tiny.png" />) are challenging!
